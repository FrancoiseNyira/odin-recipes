            together until well combined and oat mixture is completely coated. </li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into the prepped baking dish and evenly distribute it. Press down
            firmly with a spatula. Place in the freezer for at least an hour to chill.</li>
        <li>Melt the 1 cup chocolate chips in the microwave (30 second increment first and then
            15 second increments after until melted, to ensure it doesn’t burn). For the
            drizzle, add the 2 tbsp chocolate chips and the 1 tsp coconut oil in a small bowl and
            microwave until melted.</li>
        <li>Take the chilled granola mixture out of the freezer, remove from the dish. Transfer 
            the parchment paper to a large cookie sheet. Cut into 16 even bars. Dip them in the 
            chocolate or use a spoon to coat one side of the bar with the melted chocolate. Set 
            the bars chocolate side down on the cookie sheet. Drizzle with chocolate and coconut 
            oil mixture. Place them back in the freezer for an additional 5 minutes to let the 
            chocolate firm up. Store in the freezer or serve immediately</li>
