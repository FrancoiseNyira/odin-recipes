    <h3>Chicken burger with Chimichurri</h3>
    <p>We fixed the chicken burger, and all it really took was stirring in a couple spoons of 
        chimichurri sauce. No longer sort of dry and kind of boring, this is one of the best 
        burgers you'll ever have.</p>   
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <h5>Chicken Burger</h5> 
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground chicken</li> 

        <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
        
        <li>2 tsp chopped garlic</li> 
        
        <li>2 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        
        <li>Salt and pepper</li> 
        
        <li>Olive oil or spray for cooking</li>
        
        <li>4 slices of smoked gouda cheese</li>
        
        <li>4 brioche buns</li> 
        
        <li>Lettuce for topping</li>
        
        <li>Tomato for topping</li>
        
        <li>Red onion for topping</li>
    </ul>   
    <h5>Chimichurri</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup olive oil </li>
        <li>2 tbsp red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 cup flat leaf parsley, finely chopped </li>
        <li>¼ cup cilantro, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 tsp chopped garlic (~6 cloves)</li>
        <li>1 red chili pepper finely chopped</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul> 
    <h4>Steps</h4> 
    <ol>
        <li>Make the chimichurri first to allow it some time to rest so the flavors seep into 
            the oil. In a bowl, add the olive oil, vinegar, parsley, cilantro, garlic, salt, and 
            pepper. Whisk until well combined. Let sit for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the chimichurri is resting, make the burgers. In a large bowl, add the ground 
            chicken, shallot, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. Using your hands, 
            mix together so everything is evenly combined. Divide the mixture into 4 sections, 
            roll into balls, and then flatten into patties. </li>
        <li>Preheat some olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil shimmers, 
            add the burgers and cook until cooked all the way through or the internal temperature 
            reaches 165°F (about 5-7 minutes each side). Remove the burgers from the skillet to a 
            plate and top with the cheese so it begins to melt. </li>
        <li>Assemble the burgers on the buns, top with the chimichurri, lettuce, onion, 
            tomato or whatever toppings you prefer. Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
